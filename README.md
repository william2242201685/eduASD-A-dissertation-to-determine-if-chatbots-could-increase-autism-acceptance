# Could chatbots increase autism acceptance in the United Kingdom through data scraping?


## 1: About the project

### 1A: Project Aim
The main aim of the study is to conclude if data scraping techniques in chatbot technologies could be utilised towards the improvement of autism acceptance of autism for the general public of the United Kingdom. The research will also conclude if such technologies can improve the wellbeing of autistic individuals and family-members/guardians/parents of autistic relatives.

### 1B: Objectives
Objective 1: Investigate previous literature on the impact of autism misconceptions/stigmas in the United Kingdom on autistic individuals, parents and the general public. The utility and best practices of chatbot technologies for autism and mental health-related wellbeing and support and the best practices and risks towards data scraping of medical information and data.

Objective 2: Conduct a semi-structured interview with an autism specialist stakeholder to narrow the development scope towards identifying the key misconceptions and support barriers of autism as the main user requirements.

Objective 3: Develop a chatbot algorithm with the intents and responses scraped from the website/data-analysis from the stakeholders’ requirements.

Objective 4: Test the chatbot prototype on unseen user-testers and distribute a user-acceptance test survey.

Objective 5: Conclude the success of the application towards the chatbot's success towards increasing autism acceptance by analysing the qualitative and quantitative outputs from the user-acceptance test.

### 1C: Research Questions
Research Question 1: What is the current range of autism misconceptions and confusions in the United Kingdom?

Research Question 2: How effective are chatbot technologies towards increasing autism education and acceptance?

Research Question 3: How effective are chatbot technologies towards increasing wellbeing?

Research Question 4: What factors are required to develop an effective chatbot for increasing autism acceptance?

## 2: Project Abstract
The mental health sector has significantly been affected by resource gaps as a result of the coronavirus which has significantly taken a toll on the availability of support for autistic individuals and/or parents who may have unanswered/underlying questions which could significantly affect their wellbeing. The problem regarding this is that acceptance in the United Kingdom is significantly low as only 24% of questioned autistic adults believe that the general public and/or parents have a general understanding of autism to successfully define autism traits. The problem regarding this is that public misconceptions/stigma of autism can significantly affect an autistic person's interpretation of autism which can contribute towards imposters syndrome, embarrassment of their condition and/or forming unhealthy misconceptions/expectations about themselves and/or their child which could significant deteriorate their mental health and wellbeing. Therefore, this study aims to develop a chatbot to determine if such technologies can increase autism acceptance in the United Kingdom and turn identify if such technologies could increase the wellbeing of autistic individuals and/or parents of autistic children. Based on the research conducted on the literature review on the effects of misconceptions for autistic people, the effects on misconceptions for parents, the best practices and utilities of chatbot technologies and the best practices for data scraping then a semi-structured interview was composed on a retired autism specialist with 38 years of experience as to conclude on the key-requirements a professional believes should be utilized to increase autism acceptance and wellbeing in modern Britain through the identification of the most common misconceptions of autism that can be found in the United Kingdom. From this then it has been identified that the most common misconception is that the general public generally doesn’t understand that behavioral-factors/symptoms/conditions/mental-health are different from person-to-person and most of the discrimination/judgmental aspects come from individuals who don’t particularly see such symptoms as autistic and falsely assume it is due to bad behavior. 

The data collected from the interview was then utilized towards narrowing the scope of the project to avoid feature creep overstepping the timeframe of the project and as a means to scrape the most relevant data corresponding to the stakeholder's proposed requirements. From this then 46 professional/medical websites were scraped with 83 autism-related questions and 623 recognisable phrases. The results from the literature review[Best-practices/terminologies/intents] and the semi-structured interview were then utilized to develop a functional prototype which saw testing accuracy reach 95.0%+ testing accuracy[liminal-conflicts] and developer-testing-accuracy[unseen-data] achieve 70-85% accuracy. The developed prototype was then distributed along with a questionnaire to perform a user-acceptance test on if such technologies could improve autism acceptance/wellbeing. The conclusion is that chatbot technologies have shown a significant in the field of mental health as an intuitive tool to educate individuals regarding mental health inquiries and have significantly shown that through education then autism acceptance could significantly increase in the united kingdom but to improve acceptance requires significant participant testing iterations to ensure user satisfaction is achieved to ensure significant acceptance is maintainable and to ensure that all questions and/or requests for support are recognisable even with different terminologies and/or typing behaviours.

## 5: Instructions for EXE installation
Please Note That This Application On Works On Windows

Please Note that this application only works on Chrome and/or edge - Please paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser after the EDUasd chatbot application finishes

Step 1: Please save the eduASD folder to your PC. Please ensure not to move or delete any files in the eduASD folder as this can cause issues when you are compiling and running the chatbot application.

Step 2: Please take your time to read the information sheet labelled “B - Consent” as to give you a better understanding of your role in the research whilst giving you peace of mind that your data will be completely anonymised and secure whilst also identifying if you want to continue on with the study.

Step 3: To start the application then please click on the “C – Chatbot” folder and then click the EDUasd chatbot application. This will open a command prompt in which will start to train the chatbot on the scraped data stored in the resources folder.

Step 3.1: You may receive a warning specifying that windows has protected your PC. This warning is benign as the application won’t affect your computer. All you need to do to overcome this is to click on “more info” and then click on “run anyway”

Step 3.2: The application may take up to five minutes for any activity to be apparent.

Step 3.3: There may be benign tensorflow warnings/errors will pop up at the start. Don’t worry, nothing is wrong and please don’t close the program.

Step 3.4: The screen will fill with training data and will continue until 200 epochs/loops, it is almost time to test the chatbot.

Step 3.5: After the training finishes, the program will automatically open your web browser to the chatbot, please do not close the EDUasd chatbot application/terminal as this will be utilised to compile and predict your response

Step 3.6: If the chatbot does not seem to respond then please copy and paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a chrome or edge browser

Step 4: You can now test the chatbot application. Try inputting common misconceptions and/or general inquires regarding autism and autistic people. You can also try asking questions towards increasing the wellbeing of autistic individuals such general support and therapy opportunities and inquiries.
*Please note, the chatbot is designed not to collect any conversational data during your time experimenting with the chatbot*
