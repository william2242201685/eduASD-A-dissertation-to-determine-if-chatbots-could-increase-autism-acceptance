# eduASD-A-dissertation-to-determine-if-chatbots-could-increase-autism-acceptance

Dear Participant.

I would like to thank you personally for taking your time to help towards my research towards discovering the openings of chatbot and data scraping technologies towards the education, acceptance, and wellbeing of autism in the United Kingdom.

Please Note That This Application On Works On Windows

Please Note that this application only works on Chrome and/or edge - Please paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser after the EDUasd chatbot application finishes

Step 1: Please save the eduASD folder to your PC. Please ensure not to move or delete any files in the eduASD folder as this can cause issues when you are compiling and running the chatbot application.

Step 2: Please take your time to read the information sheet labelled “B - Consent” as to give you a better understanding of your role in the research whilst giving you peace of mind that your data will be completely anonymised and secure whilst also identifying if you want to continue on with the study.

Step 3: To start the application then please click on the “C – Chatbot” folder and then click the EDUasd chatbot application. This will open a command prompt in which will start to train the chatbot on the scraped data stored in the resources folder.

Step 3.1: You may receive a warning specifying that windows has protected your PC. This warning is benign as the application won’t affect your computer. All you need to do to overcome this is to click on “more info” and then click on “run anyway”

Step 3.2: The application may take up to five minutes for any activity to be apparent.

Step 3.3: There may be benign tensorflow warnings/errors will pop up at the start. Don’t worry, nothing is wrong and please don’t close the program.

Step 3.4: The screen will fill with training data and will continue until 200 epochs/loops, it is almost time to test the chatbot.

Step 3.5: After the training finishes, the program will automatically open your web browser to the chatbot, please do not close the EDUasd chatbot application/terminal as this will be utilised to compile and predict your response

Step 3.6: If the chatbot does not seem to respond then please copy and paste http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a chrome or edge browser

Step 4: You can now test the chatbot application. Try inputting common misconceptions and/or general inquires regarding autism and autistic people. You can also try asking questions towards increasing the wellbeing of autistic individuals such general support and therapy opportunities and inquiries.
*Please note, the chatbot is designed not to collect any conversational data during your time experimenting with the chatbot*

Kindest regards,
